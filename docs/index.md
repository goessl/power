# power

An exponentiation Python package.

```python
>>> from poly import polymul, polyone
>>> from power import pow_N_binary
>>> p = (1, 2, 3)
>>> n = 3
>>> pow_N_binary(p, n, mul=polymul, one=polyone)
(1, 6, 21, 44, 63, 54, 27)
```

## Installation

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/goessl/power.git
```

## Usage

::: power
